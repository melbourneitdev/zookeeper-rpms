# Overview

Note
=====
This fork of https://github.com/skottler/zookeeper-rpms has only minor changes which include using version 3.4.6 of Zookeeper and requiring "jre" instead of "java", which stops Centos trying to download a heap of dependencies if you have Oracle JRE already installed.

This repository contains everything needed to build RPM's for zookeeper, including libzookeeper and the devel packages. Different pieces are taken from places around the internet; the init script is quite close to Cassandra's. Individual packages will be built for zookeeper, libzookeeper, and zookeeper-devel.

The spec has been tested only on EL6 with the EPEL repo enabled, but should also work on recent Fedoras, too.

# Building
1. `git clone https://github.com/skottler/zookeeper-rpms`

5. `rpmbuild -bs --nodeps --define "_sourcedir ." --define "_srcrpmdir ." zookeeper.spec`
